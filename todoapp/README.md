their list. This form collects various details about the task, includding:

- **Category:** Represents a broader goal that ecompasses several tasks.
- **Task Name:** Describes the specific task.
- **Priority:** Indicates the priority of the task.
- **Timeframe:** Users can specify a preffered time range and the day of the week when they
have time to complete the task.
- **Date:** If the task if a scheduled event, users can input the date
- **Time:** If the task if a scheduled event, users can input the time

- **Completeon status:**
All added tasks are displayed in a list within a table. For each task there is a checkbox on
the left for marking completion. When a task is marked as completed, it automatically disappears
from the list. Users can reviev their completed tasks in the "Completed" tab.

- **Delete task**
On the right side of each task, there is a delete button. Clicking this button triggers a pop-up
window, confirming whether the user wishes to delete the task. If confirmed, the task is promptly
removed from the list.


##### AGENDA:
The Agenda section serves as a dedicated space

##### COMPLETED:

The Completed section provides users a retrospective view of tasks that habe been successfully
accomplished. Tasks that were marked as completed from the Planning or Agenda sections are
automatically moved to this dedicated area.

The central component of the Completed section is a table displaying the tasks. Each completed task
is shown with a strikethrough effect on its name, providing a visual cue of its accomplished status.
Additionally, a checkbox is displayed on the left side of each completed task, mirroring the
functionality in the Planning and Agenda sections. This checkbox, when checked, offers users the
ability to revert a task to active task list if needed.

Similar to the Planning and Agenda sections, a delete button is available on the right side of each
completed task. Clicking this button removes the completed task from the records without the pop-up
window.
